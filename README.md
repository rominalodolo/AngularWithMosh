## Installations

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

then run these commands 

node --version 

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli 
`ng --version` 

My MAC is older than 10.15 so the latest version of node is not supported on my machine. This person had the same response I did: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74709494/is-it-possible-to-install-node-js-on-macos-high-sierra-version-10-13-6-this-is)
[nvm download](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

to check is downloads are successful check the versions of your installations 

creating your first project: 
run: `ng new hello-world`
